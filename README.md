Capstone Project 2 made during Tech Elevator Coding Bootcamp

# What I Learned

* Used SpringBoot to set up a Java MVC to enable data persistance in a SQL database.
* SqlRowSet and jdbcTemplate classes' ability to Create, Read, Update, Destroy data allowing database manipulation from the command line.
* Created appropriate SQL queries with sanitized inputs to avoid and prevent injection attacks.
